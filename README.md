# What is attrition in business?
Attrition in business describes a gradual but deliberate reduction of staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced. The term is also sometimes used to describe the loss of customers or clients as they mature beyond a product or company's target market without being replaced by a younger generation.

# How attrition affect a company?
A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an organization. Job postings, hiring processes, paperwork and new hire training are some of the common expenses of losing employees and replacing them. Additionally, regular employee turnover prohibits your organization from increasing its collective knowledge base and experience over time. This is especially concerning if your business is customer facing, as customers often prefer to interact with familiar people. Errors and issues are more likely if you constantly have new workers.

# What are Positive and Negative attrition?

# Positive attrition
positive attrition refers to staff turnover that actually benefits the organization. Think of an employee who is a poor performer, makes many errors, has difficulty working with others, delivers low quality customer service and/or uses sick leave and vacation time as the hours are earned. When the employee quits, the organization benefits because now the supervisor can replace the low performer employee with someone who is better for the organization.

# Negative attrition:
Negative attrition refers to the loss of an employee the organization would like to keep. Qualified and skilled employees leave for a variety of reasons, and it is often challenging to find an equally skilled replacement. Negative attrition, especially in industries with the highest turnover rates, is expensive. The organization must once again recruit, assess, hire and train a new employee, and until the position is filled, team productivity declines.

# Our Objectives:
•	Study the Hr employee attrition data to identify the patters and causes of attrition with respect to various parameters.
•	Identify the important parameter and generate helpful insights from them.
•	Build model to predict if the employee is unsatisfied and will resign or is satisfied and will stay.
•	Compare the parameters of a satisfied and an unsatisfied employee to come up with idea of what can be improved.
•	Identify future attrition early so that proper measures can be taken on time.
